\section*{Introduction}

The notes correspond to the master  
course \emph{Representation theory of algebras} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve two-hour lectures. 

Most of the material is based on standard 
results of the representation theory of finite groups. 
Basic texts on representation theory are \cite{MR1369573} 
and \cite{MR2270898}. 

The notes include many exercises, some with full detailed solutions. Mandatory exercises have a \colorbox{green!5!white}{green background}, while optional ones
(bonus exercises) have a \colorbox{yellow!15!white}{yellow background}.

The notes also include some additional comments. While these are entirely optional, I hope they offer further insight. They are highlighted with a \colorbox{red!5!white}{pink background}.

The notes include Magma code, which we use to verify examples and offer alternative solutions to certain exercises. Magma \cite{zbMATH01077111} is a powerful software tool designed for working with algebraic structures. There is a free \href{https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/}{online} version of Magma available.
